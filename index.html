<p>A hackathon is an event in which computer programmers, graphical artists and project managers collaborate on software projects. A hackathon can last anywhere from three to forty-eight hours in length and brings together some of the best upcoming minds in the tech industry. Network with some of the best companies in the tech industry and build something!</p>

<a name="why-participate-in-a-hackathon" class="anchor" href="#why-participate-in-a-hackathon"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why participate in a hackathon?</h3>

<p>Hackathons provide students with opportunities to learn new software technologies, hardware and gain real-world programming experience outside of the classroom, and make connections with professionals in the field. Build something cool and present your hack! Learn, have fun, and win prizes!</p>

<a name="how-does-wilhack-fit-in" class="anchor" href="#how-does-wilhack-fit-in"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does WilHack fit in?</h3>

<p>Formal computer science classes provide a basis for programming, but many students don't know where to start in order to turn their innovative ideas into realities. We show students the ropes when it comes to source control, app development, and practical applications of coding knowledge. WilHack fosters innovation by providing a mentor process that bridges the gap between the classroom and professional computer science community. </p>
