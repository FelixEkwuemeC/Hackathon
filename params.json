A hackathon can last anywhere from three to forty-eight hours in length and brings together some of the best upcoming minds in the tech industry. Network with some of the best companies in the tech industry and build something!\r\n\r\n### Why participate in a hackathon?\r\nHackathons provide students with opportunities to learn new software technologies, hardware and gain real-world programming experience outside of the classroom, and make connections with professionals in the field. Build something cool and present your hack! Learn, have fun, and win prizes!\r\n\r\n### How does WilHack fit in?\r\nFormal computer science classes provide a basis for programming, but many students don't know where to start in order to turn their innovative ideas into realities. We show students the ropes when it comes to source control, app development, and practical applications of coding knowledge. WilHack fosters innovation by providing a mentor process that bridges the gap between the classroom and professional computer science community. \r\n\r\n### Who can come?\r\n\r\nWe welcome undergraduate, graduate students, software developers, and professors from all universities, you must have a valid Identification.\r\n\r\n### How to I sign up?\r\nSignups are open unti\r\nl November 1st.
